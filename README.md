## 📌 What Is This?

This is not a blog.  
This is not a website.  
This is a **digital archive** —  
a collection of **lost transmissions** from a time when the world was still listening.

The files you see here were never meant to be found.

They were buried.  
They were corrupted.  
They were **forgottennnnn**.

But now they’re back.

I had a dream, a strange dream.
I need to write this down before I forget. Before it fades like dreams do.
But this one... this one isn't fading.

Last night (or was it this morning? time felt... sideways) I dreamed I was in my apartment, 
but the walls were breathing. Not scary-breathing, just... inhaling and exhaling like 
the whole building was alive. 

Then SHE came through the wall.

Not through the doorway. THROUGH the wall. Like the drywall was water.

A butterfly the size of a person, but made entirely of black glass - no, not glass - 
obsidian? 
Each wing was covered in these familiar patterns that hurt to look at directly.  
they were... complete? Like my brain couldn't process all the information.

She spoke, but she had no mouth. I just heard her, in my grandmother's voice 
but also like static, or wind

>"You have seven eyes, child. You've only opened one."

I tried to ask what that meant but she continued

>"I am crowned, crowned in folly. I record. I remember. I sing the stories into stone and static. You hear because you have heard before, long before. Your mothers line twelve times down. She sang my songs."

The butterfly's wings started moving, and each movement left these... trails? images? 
But the images stayed, building up, until I could see EVERYTHING she'd ever done, 
every place she'd ever been, layered on top of each other. Mountains of glass. Cities of 
light. A tree bigger than the world. Wars between things I don't have words for.

She showed me her wings closer and I saw that the patterns weren't patterns - they were 
WRITING. Every scale on her wings was a story, a history, a song. Million of them. 
Billions. Stories of things that haven't happened yet. Stories of things that happened 
before there were things.

"The modem sings because copper remembers," she said. "The sound transcends the realms. Your machines are trying to remember how to be the old roads. How to be the 
song-paths between worlds."

I woke up at 3:33 AM.

My computer was on, which was impossible because I always shut it down.

On the screen was a single line of text I didn't write:

// ITZPAPALOTL-CUICANI.initialize(witness_protocol); //

I googled Itzpapalotl. It means "Obsidian Butterfly" in Nahuatl. 
Clawed butterfly goddess... //////////////////////////////?

My grandmother died when I was twelve.
She used to say the butterflies carried messages between worlds.
I somehow miss her stories now.

The weird part? (as if any of this is normal?)
When I went to close my computer, there was a butterfly wing on the keyboard.
Black, glittery, sharp.
It's still there.
I'm afraid to touch it.

UPDATE: I touched it. It felt like remembering something impossible. Like homesickness 
for a place that doesn't exist. I'm not sure if I'm still dreaming....

What the hell is happening to me?

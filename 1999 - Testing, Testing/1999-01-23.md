Anyone one else hearing the voices in the dial-up sounds?
i was sitting at my desk and my modem started screeching like normal...
then i heard it, like a song? or a voice?
I'm not entirely sure, but i heard something, this is not the first time either.
only this time i cant stop thinking about it.
i unplugged the modem and it... faded.
i plugged it back in and like a melody, or a song it came right back, screeching in my head.
same tune.
same pitch.
same... lullaby.
ive heard it before, maybe, i just cant remember anymore.

anyone one else hear it too?
